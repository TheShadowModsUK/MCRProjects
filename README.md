# MCreator Examples Projects
This is the unofficial place to download tutorials that others have covered for [MCreator](https://mcreator.net/) on there YouTube like channels called [NorthWestTrees Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8XYkALuEvGlKhza5Uyb7uQ) or discord/forums/reddit.   
  
This repository is not associated with Pylo or MCreator and most likely the creators but does provide useful examples of things I have done in the past with the software. Feel free to use them however you like in your mods or projects.
